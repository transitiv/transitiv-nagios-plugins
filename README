This package contains several useful Nagios/Icinga plugins, complete
with configuration files, PNP4Nagios templates and tests.

Plugins
=======

SNMP
----

* check_cisco_fans.pl: Checks the status of fans on Cisco devices
  supporting the CISCO-ENVMON-MIB.
* check_cisco_load.pl: Checks the CPU load average against user defined
  thresholds on Cisco devices supporting the CISCO-PROCESS-MIB or
  CISCO-PROCESS-MIB.
* check_cisco_psu.pl: Checks the status of power supply units on Cisco
  devices supporting the CISCO-ENVMON-MIB.
* check_cisco_temperatures.pl: Checks the status of temperature sensors
  on Cisco devices supporting the CISCO-ENVMON-MIB.
* check_snmp_printer.pl: Checks the status of a printer supporting the
  RFC1759 printer MIB (this should include pretty much all networkable
  printers).

Other
-----

* check_wordpress.pl: Checks whether a WordPress website is running the
  latest available version by querying the WordPress API. The site must
  include a generator meta tag in order for the plugin to ascertain the
  currently installed version (this is the default in most themes).

Installation
============

This package uses GNU autotools for configuration and installation.

If you have cloned the git repository then you will need to run
`autoconf' to generate the required files.

Run `./configure --help' to see a list of available install options. The
default locations for included files are as follows:

* Plugins are installed into LIBEXECDIR
* Nagios configuration files are installed into SYSCONFDIR
* PNP4Nagios templates are installed into DATAROOTDIR/pnp4nagios/templates
  if `--with-pnp-templates' is passed as an argument to the configure
  script.

It is highly likely that you will want to customise these locations to
suit your needs. An example follows:

./configure --prefix=/usr \
	--libexecdir=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins
	--sysconfdir=/etc/nagios3/conf.d \
	--with-pnp-templates=/usr/local/share/pnp4nagios/templates

After `./configure' has completed successfully run `make install' and
you're done!

Note that it is recommended to run the tests before installing, see
below for information.

Tests
=====

Some basic plugin tests are included by default. Owing to the fact
that most plugins involve communication with external hosts, it is
extremely difficult to write a suite of tests that are both
comprehensive and portable.

In order to invoke the test suite run `make check' after configure.
